# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
### My name is Chen-Yang Yeh, but you can call me Leo.  
I am passionate about becoming a highly skilled embedded software engineer, with a strong focus on **operating systems**, **embedded systems**, and **firmware** development.  

With a deep interest in low-level programming and system architecture, I am constantly striving to enhance my knowledge and expertise in these areas. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and solve complex challenges in the field, as I work towards building a successful career in software engineering.

## ðŸ”­ Experience
### Coding Ape
*Sep. 2021 - Aug. 2024*
- Taught programming concepts including basic syntax, program structure, pointers, object-oriented design, stack, queue, linked list, tree, hash table data structures and searching, sorting algorithms in C, C++, and Python.
- Ensured students developed strong foundational knowledge and problem-solving skills needed for advanced programming challenges.

### Department of Physics, NCKU
*Sep. 2022 - Aug. 2023*
- Designed, analyzed, and implemented digital infrared sensor circuits for educational teaching aids featured at a Physics Education Science Fair. Responsibilities included soldering components, creating custom laser-cut enclosures, and performing circuit safety tests with laboratory equipment.
- Collaborated withi the design team to develop and maintain Arduino programs in C++ to ensure accuracy and reliability, contributing to a successful exhibition.

### Department of Economics, NCKU
*Sep. 2020 - Feb. 2021*  
- Developed, modified and improved data crawler programs using Selenium in Python to efficiently extract air pollution data from NASA.
- Used Stata and regression methods to analyze more than 300 million data points to investigate the relationship between childrenâ€™s IQ and PM2.5 index in Africa.

## âš¡ Extracurricular Activities
### Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)
*Sep. 2022 - Aug. 2023*
- Developed web-based [algorithm visualizers](https://tseanlin.github.io/Sorting_Visualizer/) using HTML/CSS and Javascript with the React framework, which were used as teaching tools at Coding Ape.
- Mentored team members in C/C++ programming, providing guidance on key topics including sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort) and their time and space complexity.

## ðŸŒ± Education  
### National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)
- **Research Interests**: Operating System ([Linux Kernel](https://hackmd.io/@YangYeh/linux2024) Concurrency, Scheduler and Libraries), Embedded System, Firmware, and Quantum Communication.
